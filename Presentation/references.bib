  abstract = {Frequently, economic theory places shape restrictions on functional relationships between economic variables. This paper develops a method to constrain the values of the first and second derivatives of nonparametric locally polynomial estimators. We apply this technique to estimate the state price density (SPD), or risk-neutral density, implicit in the market prices of options. The option pricing function must be monotonic and convex. Simulations demonstrate that nonparametric estimates can be quite feasible in the small samples relevant for day-to-day option pricing, once appropriate theory-motivated shape restrictions are imposed. Using S\&P 500 option prices, we show that unconstrained nonparametric estimators violate the constraints during more than half the trading days in 1999, unlike the constrained estimator we propose.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new nonparametric method for estimating the conditional risk-neutral density (RND) from a cross-section of option prices. The idea of the method is to fit option prices by finding the optimal density in a special admissible set. The admissible set consists of functions, each of which may be represented as a convolution of a positive kernel with another density. The method is termed the positive convolution approximation (PCA). The important properties of PCA are that it (1) is completely agnostic about the data generating process, (2) controls against overfitting while allowing for small samples, (3) always produces arbitrage-free estimators, and (4) is computationally simple. In a Monte-Carlo experiment, PCA is compared to several popular methods: mixtures of lognormals (with one, two, and three lognormals), Hermite polynomials, two regularization methods (for the RND and for implied volatilities), and sigma shape polynomials. PCA is found to be a promising alternative to the competitors.},

  abstract = {This paper implements the time-state preference model in a multi-period economy, deriving the prices of primitive securities from the prices of call options on aggregate consumption. These prices permit an equilibrium valuation of assets with uncertain payoffs at many future dates. Furthermore, for any given portfolio, the price of a \$1.00 claim received at a future date, if the portfolio's value is between two given levels at that time, is derived explicitly from a second partial derivative of its call-option pricing function. An intertemporal capital asset pricing model is derived for payoffs that are jointly lognormally distributed with aggregate consumption. It is shown that using the Black-Scholes equation for options on aggregate consumption implies that individuals' preferences aggregate to isoelastic utility.},

Two complementary Monte Carlo experiments are conducted and the performance of the two RND estimators is evaluated by the root mean integrated squared error (RMISE) criterion. Results from both experiments show that the DFCH method outperforms the SML method for the overall quality of the estimated RNDs concerning both accuracy and stability. An application of the two methods to the OTC currency options market is also presented.},

  abstract = {A State Price Density (SPD) is the density function of a risk neutral equivalent martingale measure for option pricing, and is indispensable for exotic option pricing and portfolio risk management. Many approaches have been proposed in the last two decades to calibrate a SPD using financial options from the bond and equity markets. Among these, non and semiparametric methods were preferred because they can avoid model mis-specification of the underlying. However, these methods usually require a large data set to achieve desired convergence properties. One faces the problem in estimation by e.g., kernel techniques that there are not enough observations locally available. For this situation, we employ a Bayesian quadrature method because it allows us to incorporate prior assumptions on the model parameters and hence avoids problems with data sparsity. It is able to compute the SPD of both call and put options simultaneously, and is particularly robust when the market faces the data sparsity issue. As illustration, we calibrate the SPD for weather derivatives, a classical example of incomplete markets with financial contracts payoffs linked to non-tradable assets, namely, weather indices. Finally, we study related weather derivatives data and the dynamics of the implied SPDs.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose the B-spline (BSP) method, which overcomes problems with the smoothed implied volatility smile (SML) method for estimating option implied risk-neutral measures (RNMs). We model the risk-neutral cumulative distribution function (CDF) using quartic B-splines with power tails so that the resulting risk-neutral probability density function (PDF) has continuity and arbitrage-free properties. Since the number of knots is selected optimally in constructing the quartic B-spline risk-neutral CDF, our method avoids both overfitting and oversmoothing. To improve computational efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a three-step RNM estimation procedure that transforms a nonlinear optimization problem into a convex quadratic program. Monte-Carlo experiments and applications to S\&P 500 index options suggest that the BSP method performs considerably better than the SML method. The BSP method always produces arbitrage-free RNM estimators and almost perfectly recovers the actual risk-neutral PDFs for various hypothetical distributions.},

To address this issue, we propose a semi-nonparametric model that allows to compute exact credible intervals around estimated distributions. By analyzing a panel of S\&P 500 options, we find that the estimates of the distributions are quite precise. We also provide evidence that the multi-modality often found in option-implied distributions could be an artifact due to over-fitting, and that models with uni-modality constraints have high posterior odds.},
