  abstract = {Frequently, economic theory places shape restrictions on functional relationships between economic variables. This paper develops a method to constrain the values of the first and second derivatives of nonparametric locally polynomial estimators. We apply this technique to estimate the state price density (SPD), or risk-neutral density, implicit in the market prices of options. The option pricing function must be monotonic and convex. Simulations demonstrate that nonparametric estimates can be quite feasible in the small samples relevant for day-to-day option pricing, once appropriate theory-motivated shape restrictions are imposed. Using S\&P 500 option prices, we show that unconstrained nonparametric estimators violate the constraints during more than half the trading days in 1999, unlike the constrained estimator we propose.},

  abstract = {This paper implements the time-state preference model in a multi-period economy, deriving the prices of primitive securities from the prices of call options on aggregate consumption. These prices permit an equilibrium valuation of assets with uncertain payoffs at many future dates. Furthermore, for any given portfolio, the price of a \$1.00 claim received at a future date, if the portfolio's value is between two given levels at that time, is derived explicitly from a second partial derivative of its call-option pricing function. An intertemporal capital asset pricing model is derived for payoffs that are jointly lognormally distributed with aggregate consumption. It is shown that using the Black-Scholes equation for options on aggregate consumption implies that individuals' preferences aggregate to isoelastic utility.},

  abstract = {Estimates of option-implied probability distributions are routinely used in central banks, as well as in other institutions, but their reliability is often difficult to assess. To address this issue, we propose a semi-nonparametric model that allows to compute exact credible intervals around estimated distributions. By analyzing a panel of S\&P 500 options, we find that the estimates of the distributions are quite precise. We also provide evidence that the multi-modality often found in option-implied distributions could be an artifact due to over-fitting, and that models with uni-modality constraints have high posterior odds.},
